2010 .. base 10
cvt to base 4

here we move from bigger base (10) to smaller (4)

(2* 4^3) + (0 * 4^2) + (1 * 4^1) + (0 * 4^0) = 

128 + 0 +  4 + 0  = 132

to convert from any base to another. We basically convert from that base to base 10 and then to the next base


1000 ... binary (base  2) ...1000

1 * 2^3 = 8-base10
